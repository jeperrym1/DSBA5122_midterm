# NCNHP Species Analysis

# 

INTRODUCTION: 
This Tableau workbook is used to provide the user with an interactive workbook that is focusing on three North Carolina counties that were heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene in early October 2024. The purpose is to show what species are located in the region and if they are listed in this data, they are protected to a certain degree, whether that is federally, NC, or county listed. 

DATA:
This data set is compiled from the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program. This program is from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and their goal is to accurately document species that are native to North Carolina and track their status, as in if they are endangered or if they are vulnerable etc. The NCNHP has been documenting different counties since the 90's and they are continuously reassessing and keeping up to date information that is updated quarterly. The data that I specifically used for my project was the county data for Buncombe county, Rutherford County, and Yancey County. 

FUTURE WORK:
I would really like to continue this project because I have lived in North Carolina for my entire adult life and I love this state. The region is special and I care for it deeply. With the devestation that Hurricane Helene brought, I believe that it is extremely important to keep the natural communities under observance to accurately describe how they have been impacted alongside the people who live in the areas that were impacted. I would like to incorporate the "Habitat Description" field that is within the data source but I was unable to do so for this midterm. I also believe that I can provide more detail on this data set and expand on the "Natural Community" grouping because that is not 1 or 2 species, those are distinct communities that are unique and have special properties to the mthat help them operate and I believe that this data could provide some very interesting findings with what species are dwelling there and what makes it a unique occurence. Overall I really enjoyed this midterm but I really wish I had more time to pour into it.
